# PUF-State-Distribution

The goal of this project is to create a public-use file (PUF) with income-tax microdata that represents not just the U.S. as a whole, but each of the 50 states. The initial goal is to construct a file that is consistent with known or estimated values for each state, for many variables, for a recent historical year.
