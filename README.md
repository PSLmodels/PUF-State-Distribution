# PUF-State-Distribution

The goal of this project is to create a public-use file (PUF) with income-tax microdata that represents not just the U.S. as a whole, but each of the 50 states. The initial goal is to construct a file that is consistent with known or estimated values for each state, for many variables, for a recent historical year.

We anticipate starting with a national PUF for a recent year and using it as the basis for each state. Thus, if the national file has 150k records, then each state might, initially, have 150k records, but with different, adjusted, weights. If some of those weights are zero, the records could be dropped.

We are open to exploring other approaches, too.
